homework

If you’d like to do our code test which tests your ability to develop a html version of a Photoshop file.
 
I’ve attached a PSD file would you consider developing this page as close as the design as possible?
 
Some more information about the code test:
 
 We are looking for lean coding
The use of ‘Bourbon Neat’ framework
Fully Responsive across many break-points
Mobile view with ‘Nav draw’
Re the icons can you just use the equivalent from ‘font awesome’
Please make commits to a GITHUB repository
The crux of the test is to keep the ‘brand’ to the right whilst the browser scales onto mobile size and also note that reviewer will be interested in how you attack the sloping blue background with CSS.
You’ll need to figure out how to export the brand (four coloured fan) as an .SVG. If you get stuck on this let me know it’s difficult.
